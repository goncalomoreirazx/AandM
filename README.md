First ReactJs with tailwindCss, nodejs express project for fun.
Its supposed to be a website were u can make a list of animes and manga u watched/read.
The components are badly arranged (everything on the same folder).
Server is a bit confusing.
But as i said was my first project to learn Axios, TailwindCss, node.js and Restfull APIs.
Was made in August/September.
